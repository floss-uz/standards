# Summary

[summary]: #summary

All members of community have the right to participate in the community development process. We are open to all suggestions and initiatives aimed at development, but we ensure that all these actions are consistent with our culture and do not contradict the general floss movements. We believe that the most important foundation for community development is the contribution of all members, and this RFC is focused on contributing to Floss Uzbekistan.

# Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

Each community has its own development processes. However, each community has similar or common development processes. We implement all development processes at the Floss Uzbekistan level and require all communities to follow them. This RFC sets standards for contributing to Floss related projects or communities within Floss Uzbekistan and offers it as a programmatic practice to all Floss communities. 

# Detailed design

[detailed-design]: #detailed-design

A community chair, maintainer or volunteers are also required to follow the contribution rules, otherwise their work will not be accepted. All technical communities can also extend and implement the Floss Uzbekistan standards. However, standards with a severity of **MUST** are required to be fully implemented. It is important that all project documents are available and accessible to everyone. All projects belonging to the Floss community should have relevant results for the processes that are taking with **MUST** severity. 

In particular, all projects require contributors to submit necessary documents. These documents must state the requirements and guidelines for contributing to the project. The types of documents can vary depending on the type of project or be in the form of reports. For example, events and conferences have different requirements, so the documents related to them are also different.

All actions that do not comply with the standards of the Floss community have the right to be rejected or require changes. Contributors and their work must comply with the copyright standards of Floss. Maintaining and adhering to copyright in the project is required at the level of RFC and OSS culture. In particular, all actions that are inconsistent with or contrary to floss standards are condemned. 

# Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Some **MUST** standards may not be implemented. Therefore, the chairperson party should take some precautions and carefully implement the standards **step by step**, following all the procedures to avoid possible backlashes and maintain balance. In some projects, there is a possibility of **conflicting** point of views, in which case maintainers or chairpersons should participate in resolving these issues.

# Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- Does RFC cover organization Open Source Software ?
- Will it be easy to contribute to projects, events based on RFC?
- Should we archive rejected projects?

# Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

This RFC is the first foundational RFC related to contributing. Subsequent RFCs will reflect the documentation needed to contribute to and support the floss community.
