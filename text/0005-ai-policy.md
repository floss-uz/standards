# Summary

[summary]: #summary

This RFC explains the rules for using AI to FLOSS community members. RFC reflecting the use and contribution of AI tools in community conversations and AI-related issues during community member FLOSS activities. 

# Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

We consider this activity to be of great importance for the development of the community, and therefore we are documenting it based on the RFC. This document outlines the issue of interacting with AI tools in the community. The main reason for creating this document is the conflicts of interest regarding interactions with AI in communities. 


# Detailed design

[detailed-design]: #detailed-design

This issue consists of several sections and focuses on two main sections, and these sections are as follows. Of course, these two issues have been the subject of much discussion in the community, and for this reason, the implementation of some practices has relied more on community opinions.

- Using AI tools in community conversations, debates, and communication processes.
- Using AI tools to contribute to projects within FLOSS. 

FLOSS oppose relying on **AI-powered** sources to inform conversations and debates in all communities. The **FLOSS** community supports traditional methods then rejects or limits references that relies on AI. This section of the RFC rejects any references submitted based on AI. 

Of course, the issue of **AI-based contributions** is somewhat controversial. For this reason, the FLOSS community supports somewhat liberal positions on this issue. It should be noted that licensing issues for codes generated using AI are the responsibility of the users themselves. This means that the situation is somewhat serious, and these issues are still being widely discussed in the OSS community as a whole. For this reason, **AI-based contributions** are being made **OPTIONAL** for everyone within the FLOSS community.

Projects and communities belonging to the FLOSS community should implement **RULES** and **CODE OF CONDUCT** documents that are fully consistent with or extend these two sections of the RFC. Community chairs and maintainers should modify and implement their own policies based on these, provided they do not conflict with this RFC.
